# 0 Preamble
People should know how to:
 
 - Install softwares
 - Find paths on their machines
 - Working skills in R or python (or both!) or whatever other language (but we won't help much)
 - Install git, some kind of GUI for git, a devtool thing for your language (we propose suggestions for mac and windows and linux)


# 1 Problem/question

 * TODO: Find a question!!!!



# 2 Put the problem on paper

 - include coding and design strategies: think before doing

# 3 Split your problem

 - includes documentation
 - includes unit test
 - includes modules = **separation of concerns**

# 4 Solve your sub problems
Advance for each modules independently (don't get lost)

 - includes version control

# 5 Wrap it up

 - includes debugging
 - includes integration
 - includes packaging/archiving/repeatability

# 6 Optimisation (it's always last)

 - Verify your algorithm before making it faster
 - includes benchmarking
 - Optimise each module separately




## How to deliver it

Powerpoints of the workflow step by step introducing the concepts
In the meantime, people advance on the problems on their machines

Both teaching and coding should advance at the same time.


## wish list for later

Including C!
